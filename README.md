# News iOS App using SwiftUI and Combine in MVVM + Coordinator Architect
A basic news app using SwiftUI and Combine in MVVM+Coordinator Architect. This is my very first try to build a compete SwiftUI project and will improve and update.
I will write a medium article about it in further future.

## To run the project:
- You can easily get your NEWS API KEY from www.newsapi.com
- Then put your APIKey in Container.Swift file (I putted a mannual warning to locate it)
- The only dependency used is KingFisher (v-5.13.0). I add it using swift package manager you can add it using whatever dependecy manager you like.

## Warning!
Consider this app as my very very first SwiftUI + Combine project experience which I developed in less than a two days. There are a lots of UX and Codebase Problem. this is not how I ussually code. I will try to refactor and improve it in further future.

### Current Features:
- Completely Native: Used SwiftUI and Combine and CoreDate
- Localization: Currently Supports English and Danish (Change language in Setting)
- Have two Enviroments: Development and Production
- Modularized
